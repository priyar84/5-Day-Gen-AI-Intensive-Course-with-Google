Kaggle's 5-Day Gen-AI Intensive Course with Google
Welcome to the repository of the 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google. This repository contains links to all the daily whitepapers, podcasts, assignments, and other materials for the course.

This is a 5-day online course designed and presented by Google and Kaggle, to help you deeply understand some of the fundamental technologies and techniques behind Generative AI. Created by a team of Google’s ML researchers and engineers, this program includes both conceptual deep dives and hands-on coding examples so you can tackle new Gen AI projects with confidence.

Day 1: Foundational Large Language Models & Text Generation:
💡What You’ll Learn
Today you’ll explore the evolution of LLMs, from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. You’ll also get trained in the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction. The code lab will walk you through getting started with the Gemini API and cover several prompt techniques and how different parameters impact the prompts.
